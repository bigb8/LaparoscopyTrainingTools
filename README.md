# LaparoscopyTrainingTools

### Introduction
Box training systems with advanced skills like suturingÂ have been developed in many kinds. A portable and cheap training/testing system for basic laparoscopic techniques has been created by Thinggaard et al. (doi: 10.1002/bjs.9857). The aim of the project is to provide instruments to easily establish basic testing procedures for training and evaluation (TABLT), and can be used in various specialties before supervised patient surgery

Please note: Required skill levels vary based on the normal setting approach used  (doi: 10.1002/bjs.9857).


## What this repo is

This repository consists of a collection of tools and code to assist in creating training materials for the "Training and Assessment of Basic Laparoscopic Techniques (TABLT)" (doi: 10.1002/bjs.9857).
