# LaparoscopyTrainingTools

Box training systems with advanced skills like suturingÂ have been developed in many kinds. A portable and cheap training/testing system is  basic laparoscopic techniques which can be used in various specialties before supervised patient surgery has been created by Thinggaard et al. (doi: 10.1002/bjs.9857). The aim of the project is to provide instruments to easily establish basic testing procedures for training and evaluation (TABLT).

This repository consists of a collection of tools and code to assist in creating training materials for the "Training and Assessment of Basic Laparoscopic Techniques (TABLT)" (doi: 10.1002/bjs.9857).

All content have been made at CAMES (Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation), Capital Region of Denmark, with the intent of making fabrication of the TABLT tasks easier.
